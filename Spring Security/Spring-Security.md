Here are indicative answers for selected questions across different levels. These answers are concise and can be expanded upon for deeper understanding.

### **Basic Level Answers**
1. **What is Spring Security, and why is it used?**  
   Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Java applications. It provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks like CSRF, XSS, and session fixation.

2. **How do you secure a Spring Boot application with Spring Security?**  
   Add the Spring Security dependency to your project. By default, it secures all endpoints and provides basic authentication with a generated password (in logs). Configure security rules in a `SecurityFilterChain` bean.

3. **What are the default configurations provided by Spring Security?**  
   Default configurations include HTTP Basic authentication, session-based security, and CSRF protection for web apps.

4. **Explain the role of `Authentication` and `Authorization`.**  
   - **Authentication** verifies a user's identity.  
   - **Authorization** determines what actions an authenticated user can perform.

5. **What is CSRF protection, and how is it enabled/disabled?**  
   CSRF protection prevents cross-site request forgery attacks by requiring a CSRF token for state-changing requests. It is enabled by default but can be disabled using `.csrf().disable()` in the `SecurityFilterChain`.

### **Intermediate Level Answers**
1. **How do you implement custom authentication?**  
   Create a custom implementation of `AuthenticationProvider` or `UserDetailsService` to fetch user details and validate credentials against your logic or data source.

2. **Explain the use of `UserDetailsService`.**  
   It is a core interface used to retrieve user-related data, such as username, password, and roles, from a custom source (e.g., a database).

3. **How do you secure REST APIs?**  
   - Use JWT or OAuth2 for stateless authentication.  
   - Secure endpoints with `.antMatchers("/api/private/**").authenticated()`.  
   - Disable CSRF if APIs are stateless: `.csrf().disable()`.

4. **What is a `PasswordEncoder`?**  
   It encodes and matches passwords securely. Use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` for hashing passwords before storing them in a database.

5. **How do you restrict access to specific HTTP methods?**  
   Use `.antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/api/resource").hasRole("USER")` in the `SecurityFilterChain` configuration.

### **Advanced Level Answers**
1. **How do you implement JWT-based authentication?**  
   - Generate a JWT after successful login with user details and a secret key.  
   - Include the JWT in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.  
   - Validate the token in a custom filter added to the Spring Security filter chain.

2. **Explain stateful vs. stateless authentication.**  
   - **Stateful:** Uses server-side sessions to maintain user state.  
   - **Stateless:** Uses tokens (e.g., JWT), where the state is stored on the client side.

3. **How do you implement SSO?**  
   Integrate with an identity provider (e.g., Okta) using Spring Security OAuth2 or SAML. Configure the provider's metadata and redirect login/logout requests to the identity provider.

4. **What is `DelegatingFilterProxy`?**  
   It delegates requests to a Spring-managed filter bean, integrating the servlet filter mechanism with Spring Security.

5. **How can you audit login attempts?**  
   Use `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` and `AuthenticationFailureHandler` to log successful and failed login attempts.

---

### **Scenario-Based Answers**
1. **Securing different roles (Admin, Manager, User):**  
   Define role-specific access rules in `SecurityFilterChain` using `.antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")`, etc.

2. **"Remember Me" functionality:**  
   Enable it using `.rememberMe().key("uniqueAndSecret").tokenValiditySeconds(86400)` in the security configuration.

3. **JWT token validation logic:**  
   Decode the JWT, verify the signature using a secret key, and check the expiration date. Use the decoded claims to authenticate users.

4. **Securing a microservice-to-microservice call:**  
   Use OAuth2 tokens or mutual TLS (mTLS) for authentication between services.

5. **Restrict access during office hours:**  
   Use a custom `AccessDecisionVoter` or security expression to allow access based on time.

---

### **Real-Time Use Case Answers**
1. **Integrating with third-party identity providers:**  
   Use Spring Security OAuth2 for OpenID Connect (OIDC). Configure client credentials, redirect URIs, and endpoints provided by the identity provider.

2. **Preventing brute-force attacks:**  
   Implement an in-memory counter for login attempts and block users after a threshold is reached. Optionally, integrate tools like reCAPTCHA.

3. **Multiple authentication mechanisms:**  
   Chain authentication providers or configure multiple filter chains for different paths and mechanisms.

4. **Securing sensitive operations with OTP:**  
   Integrate an OTP library (e.g., Google Authenticator). Verify the OTP in a custom authentication filter before allowing access to sensitive operations.

5. **Custom logout mechanism:**  
   Clear user-specific data, such as cache or tokens, in `LogoutHandler`.
