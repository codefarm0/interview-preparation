### **Basic Level Questions**

1. **What are microservices? How do they differ from monolithic architecture?**  
   - **Answer:** Microservices is an architectural style where an application is broken down into smaller, independently deployable services, each with its specific responsibility.  
     - **Monolithic:** All features are part of a single application.  
     - **Microservices:** Each feature is a separate service, communicating over APIs.  
     - **Example:** In an e-commerce system, microservices could include services for inventory, user accounts, and orders, whereas a monolithic system would handle all these features in a single codebase.  

2. **What are the benefits of using microservices?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - Scalability: Scale specific services as needed.  
     - Flexibility: Use different tech stacks for different services.
