## Complex and confusing questions
Here’s a list of **lesser-known and mostly confusing questions** under microservices that often trip candidates up. These questions test deeper understanding, real-world implementation, and clarity on subtle concepts.

## **Basic to Intermediate Questions**
1. **What is the difference between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling in microservices? Why is horizontal scaling preferred?**
2. **Explain the role of "backpressure" in microservices. How does it relate to system stability?**
3. **What are the implications of having synchronous vs. asynchronous communication between microservices?**
4. **How would you manage schema evolution in microservices when services have independent data stores?**
5. **What is the N+1 query problem, and how does it occur in microservices?**
6. **Explain idempotency in the context of microservices. Why is it important for APIs?**
7. **What is the difference between service mesh and API gateway? Can they coexist?**
8. **How do you decide between CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and CRUD-based designs in microservices?**
9. **What is the difference between eventual consistency and strong consistency? When would you choose one over the other?**
10. **How does load balancing differ for REST APIs vs. message queues in microservices?**

## **Advanced and Confusing Questions**
1. **What are compensating transactions, and how are they implemented in a microservices architecture? How do they differ from rollbacks?**
2. **Why might a distributed monolith emerge from a poorly implemented microservices architecture?**
3. **What are shadow deployments, and how do they differ from blue-green or canary deployments?**
4. **How do you handle the "dual-write problem" in microservices?**

## **Scenario-Based and Tricky Questions**
1. **Scenario:** A service is reading stale data from another service’s database due to eventual consistency. How would you troubleshoot and address this?  
   - **Confusion Point:** Candidates often miss designing systems to handle stale reads or assume immediate consistency.  

2. **Scenario:** You find that increasing the number of replicas for a microservice improves read throughput but worsens write latencies. Why could this happen?  
   - **Confusion Point:** This could be caused by the replication lag or coordination overhead for consistency.

3. **Scenario:** Your microservices are deployed across multiple regions. Users in Region A report delays when accessing data primarily stored in Region B. How do you resolve this?  
   - **Confusion Point:** This involves complex concepts like data replication, latency, and proximity-based request routing.

4. **Scenario:** Two microservices need to interact frequently, but the latency of their calls starts affecting the system's SLA. How would you redesign this interaction?  
   - **Confusion Point:** Candidates might overlook options like co-locating services, caching, or switching to event-driven communication.

5. **Scenario:** An external client service frequently calls one of your APIs, causing a spike in load, resulting in degraded performance for other users. How would you handle it?  
   - **Confusion Point:** Solutions could involve rate limiting, prioritization, or throttling strategies, but many confuse these concepts.

6. **Scenario:** In a multi-tenancy system, how would you ensure each tenant's data is isolated and secure while sharing infrastructure across services?  
   - **Confusion Point:** The debate between database per tenant vs. shared schema often confuses candidates.

7. **Scenario:** You detect a cascading failure starting from one service and spreading through the system. How do you stop and prevent it in the future?  
   - **Confusion Point:** Misunderstandings about circuit breakers, bulkheads, and fallback mechanisms arise here.

8. **Scenario:** Two services, A and B, communicate via a message broker. Messages are being delivered out of order, causing issues. How would you fix this?  
   - **Confusion Point:** Ordering in distributed systems requires handling concepts like message sequencing and idempotency.

9. **Scenario:** A system needs to calculate analytics data across services but without impacting their primary function. How would you design this?  
   - **Confusion Point:** Candidates may not consider approaches like event sourcing, change data capture, or dedicated analytical pipelines.

10. **Scenario:** A service must authenticate users against multiple identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, corporate SSO). How would you implement this in a microservices system?  
    - **Confusion Point:** Candidates often miss using standardized protocols like OAuth2 or OpenID Connect.
